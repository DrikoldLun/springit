#Springit

This is a reddit clone project using spring boot 2.5.5

## 1. Springboot essentials

### 1.1 Springboot devtools
automated restart set
preference -> build... -> compiler -> auto build
preference -> advanced -> auto-make

### 1.2 Configuration and Properties
configuration
resources/application.properties
change configuration like auto restart/port
java/*/config/SpringitProperties.java
eg. server.port=8085/ spring.devtools.restart.enabled=false

configuration processor
        <dependency>
            <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
            <artifactId>spring-boot-configuration-processor</artifactId>
            <optional>true</optional>
        </dependency>
generate meta-data under target/classes/META_INF/*.jason

### 1.3 Profile
1. Let some operations happen only in certain profile
Profile(String) in application.java
set spring.profiles.active = [any String] in application.properties

2.configure different environment using profiles
touch a new applicaton-[profile].properties under resourses/ and set set spring.profiles.active = [any String] in application.properties

### 1.4 Debugging and Logging
#### debugging
can use evaluate to check the API
ApplicationContext

#### logging
1. set logging level: set logging.level.root=TRACE in application.properties for all classes
2. logging for a specific class
import org.slf4j.Logger
import org.slf4j.LoggerFactory
Logger log = LoggerFactory.getLoggers(SpringitApplication.class)
log.error(String)
set logging.level.com.lunz.springit=DEBUG

### 1.5 actuator
add some info of app
info.application.(name/description/version)
management.endpoint.health.show-details=always
management.endpoints.web.exposure.include=health,info (expose the endpoints)
all in application.properties

## 2. Spring MVC model
### 2.1 Spring data JPA
Spring data is a large project containing tons of modules like support for JDBC, JPA, MongoDB/Redis
JPA is just the specification and by itself isnâ€™t all that usefull. What you need is a JPA provider that implements the specification like
Hibernate

### Entities
Must use annotations to let Spring know the class we created are entities, use @Entity
@ID annotation specifies the primary key of the entity
@GeneratedValue annotation provides strategies for the generation of primary key values

### Project Lombok Refactor
Refactor, right click package, select refactor and rename, it will automatically update the name of this package in all files
Needed for Lombok Project: turn on annotation processor - preference/compiler/annotation processors/enable annotation processing
@NoArgsConstructor to replace no args constructor
@Data to replace setter and getter, tostring and hashequal
@NonNull for a certain property: this is required, automatically create a constructor that instantiates this object

### Repositories
after creating the domain objects, need a mechanism to get data in and out of our database
we have hibernate under the hood and we're using Aughrim to map our objects
establish Repository package, touch interface files for each entity, write in it:
public interface LinkRepository extends JpaRepository<Link,Long> {
}
We don't need to implement the repository interface, spring does it at runtime

### Entity Relationships (Mappings)
Use JPA Mapping Annotations
@OneToMany(mappedBy = "link") 1 link has many 

### Auditing Aware
some features: time for create and update, who create or update
a bunch of classes needs to be auditable, we can create an abstract class called Auditable and make it a mappeed super class, just extend
this class for those classes needing auditable features. This Auditable class doesn't not have a table, the auditable features are within 
the domain object
